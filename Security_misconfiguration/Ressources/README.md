Found weird directory in url `/.hidden/`   
In this directory there are a lot of directory who contain themself others directory ... until we got `README` file.    
The idea is to print all the `README` files. A script file will be fine !

### Resolv ?
Never let critic directories in the same dir as the website source files
Those directory must be outsite of website scope
