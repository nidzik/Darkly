Vulnerability 4:
------

On every page there is a cookie with value: `68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327`   
Decrypt in MD5 the value is : `false`
So I encrypt value `true` in MD5 and change the cookie.   
Everytime I reload the page I got the flag

### Resolv ?
Cookie ID must be set randomly and not from a password.
